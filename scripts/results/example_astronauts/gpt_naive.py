This Dagster code defines a job `astronaut_info_job` that replicates the functionality of the Airflow DAG. It uses the `@op` decorator for operations (tasks in Airflow terms) and `@graph` to define the workflow. The `DynamicOut` and `DynamicOutput` are used to handle dynamic task generation based on the number of astronauts, similar to Airflow's dynamic task mapping. The `map` method on the output of `get_astronauts` dynamically applies `print_astronaut_craft` to each astronaut.
