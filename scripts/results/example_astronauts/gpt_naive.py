Here's the Dagster equivalent of the provided Airflow code, using Dagster's asset-based approach:

```python
from dagster import job, op, graph, repository, AssetMaterialization, AssetKey
import requests

@op(out={"astronauts": dict})
def get_astronauts(context):
    """
    This op fetches data from the Open Notify API to retrieve a list of astronauts currently in space.
    It returns a dictionary containing the number of people in space and the list of astronauts.
    """
    response = requests.get("http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json")
    data = response.json()
    number_of_people_in_space = data["number"]
    list_of_people_in_space = data["people"]

    context.log_event(
        AssetMaterialization(
            asset_key=AssetKey(["current_astronauts"]),
            description="Fetched current astronauts data from API."
        )
    )

    return {"number_of_people_in_space": number_of_people_in_space, "astronauts": list_of_people_in_space}

@op
def print_astronaut_craft(context, astronauts):
    """
    This op prints the name and craft of each astronaut currently in space.
    """
    greeting = "Hello! :)"
    for astronaut in astronauts:
        craft = astronaut["craft"]
        name = astronaut["name"]
        context.log.info(f"{name} is currently in space flying on the {craft}! {greeting}")

@graph
def astronaut_etl():
    """
    This graph defines the ETL process for fetching and displaying astronaut data.
    """
    astronauts = get_astronauts()
    print_astronaut_craft(astronauts["astronauts"])

@repository
def deploy_dagster():
    """
    This repository bundles the astronaut ETL job for deployment.
    """
    return [astronaut_etl.to_job()]
```

### Key Points:
1. **@op and @graph**: These are used instead of Airflow's @task and @dag. The `@op` is used to define operations (similar to tasks), and `@graph` is used to define the workflow (similar to DAG).

2. **AssetMaterialization**: This is used to log the creation or update of an asset, which can be useful for tracking the lineage and versioning of data.

3. **Repository**: In Dagster, a repository is a collection of jobs and assets. It's used to organize and deploy your Dagster code.

4. **Logging and Context**: Dagster ops have access to a context object that can be used for logging and accessing runtime configuration.

This code should be directly executable in a Python environment where Dagster is installed, assuming network access to the Open Notify API.
